## FlashCards

This is a Next.js website that allows users to create and store flashcards in folders, and make them public. It was created using TailwindCSS as the styling components, MongoDB as the database, Node.js handling the backend, and Google OAuth for verification.

Users are able to create folders, giving them a url that they can make public or not. Within the folders, they can create cards, and view them in flashcard format or as a list. Visitors are able to search the public folders for things that they are looking for, and it would return whatever fits the search query.

The flashcards are able to be updated and deleted by the creator, and clicking them would reveal the answer or revert back to the question. The list portion of the page lists out the cards with the questions and answers, and users are able to pick how to view them by selecting the length of cards on each page.
